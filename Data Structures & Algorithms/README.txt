For Question 1 (Binary Search Tree):

NOTE: All user inputs are validated to ensure program does not crash 

    1. Compile and run the BSTTest.java file. 
    2. Insert keys (values) to populate the BST. 
    3. Insert -1 once complete. 
    4. A menu will appear to allow users to pick the next operation. 
    5. The options include inserting nodes (1), deleting nodes (2), printing the tree traversals (3), 
	 and printing the visualization of the tree (4).
    6. User can only delete nodes which already exist in the BST. Otherwise, an error message will appear.
    7. The tree traversals include Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order. 
    8. Visualization of the tree indicates the root node, left, and right subtrees. 
    6. User can insert option 5 in the menu to terminate the program.

For Question 2 (Hashing):

NOTE: All user inputs are validated to ensure program does not crash 

    1. Compile and run the HashingTest.java file. 
    2. Insert the desired collision resolution method 
       (1 for linear probing, 2 for double hashing, or 3 for separate chaining).
    3. Insert the size of hash table (must be greater than 10 for collision resolution to be effective).
    4. Insert values to populate hash table.
    5. If collision occurs, message will be printed out. Collision is resolved depending on the methods selected previously.
    6. The value is stored at a new index and message is printed out.
    7. Insert 'exit' once complete.
    8. A menu will appear to allow users to pick the next operation.
    9. The options include inserting value (1), printing partial hash table (2), 
       printing full hash table (3).
   11. Partial hash table only shows the indexes which contain values, while 
       full hash table includes indexes without values. 
   10. User can insert option 4 in the menu to terminate the program.
